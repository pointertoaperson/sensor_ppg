### Test: Arduino Due as Signal Generator

This test uses the **Arduino Due** to generate a synthetic heart rate signal at **55 BPM** (beats per minute).

- A mixed signal with different frequency corresponding to **55 BPM**  was generated.
- The signal was input into the heart rate detection system.
- The system estimated the heart rate as **54 BPM**.
